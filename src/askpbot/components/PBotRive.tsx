/**
 * PBot, animated — the source's `<x-rive file="pbot" artboard="PBot Waving">`.
 *
 * The runtime's WASM is served from `public/pbot/rive/`, not the unpkg CDN the
 * package defaults to: the source app goes CDN-free on purpose, and a third-party
 * fetch on every page load is a dependency this app does not otherwise have.
 * `scripts/pbot-design/sync.mjs` copies that file out of node_modules, which is
 * why `@rive-app/canvas` is pinned to an exact version — the JS and the WASM must
 * be the same build.
 *
 * Decorative everywhere it is used, so it renders aria-hidden.
