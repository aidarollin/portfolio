/**
 * A bot reply, rendered as markdown.
 *
 * The source does this with `x-html="md(text)"`: a regex pass that escapes
 * `& < >` and then splices tags back in. That is an injection surface — the
 * escape leaves `"` alone, so a link URL can close its own `href` and add an
 * attribute — and model output is exactly the text an attacker would steer.
 *
 * react-markdown builds React elements and never an HTML string, so there is no
 * `innerHTML` anywhere on this path. Raw HTML in the reply is dropped, not
 * rendered (no `rehype-raw`, deliberately), and the default `urlTransform`
 * strips `javascript:`, `data:` and other unsafe link targets. GFM adds the
 * tables, strikethrough and task lists models routinely produce.
 *
 * The styling is the source's `.pbot-markdown` rules, which already cover
 * `p`, `ul`/`ol`, `strong`, `em`, `code` and `pre`.
